# My Reads

I created this website as a project for my Front-End Web Development Nanodegree from Udacity. This website allows the user to keep track of books that have been read, are currently being read, or that he or she would like to read.

### installation instructions
1- Clone or download the project
2- run npm install or yarn install in the project root directory (cd on the project folder) to install dependencies
3- Run npm start or yarn start to launch the project.
